## Requirements 
### Android version
The minimum recommended Android version is 12 (Android API >= 31)

SyncStage can operate on lower distributions starting from Android 10 (Android API 29) with known limitations:

* On some devices the full ultra low latency potential will not be reached.

* Network type detection does not work correctly.

### CPU architecture
SyncStage is compatible with armeabi-v7a and arm64-v8a CPU architectures.


## Tested devices
The SyncStage low latency capabilities were tested on a series of physical devices:

* Samsung Galaxy S23
* Samsung Galaxy S22 (different variants)
* Samsung Galaxy S21 (different variants)
* Samsung Galaxy S20 (different variants)
* Samsung Z Fold 2
* Google Pixel 4a

The list is constantly getting longer. Setting up a SyncStage audio session without verifying the latency was tested **on numerous other Android devices.**
