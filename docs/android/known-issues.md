The current version of the SDK contains some known issues. However, we are diligently working to resolve them in upcoming releases.

* When headphones without a microphone are connected, the internal microphone must be manually enabled.
* Robotic sound - on some smartphones, audio quality drops occasionally.
* Disabling the internet connection during a session leads to an app crash.
* Losing network coverage results in the app crashing.
* Users may be removed from a session when the app runs in the background and the screen is locked.
* Bluetooth audio devices, e.g. headsets, speakers, are not currently supported.
