## SDK
SyncStage SDK `0.6.0` for Android contains some known issues. However, we are diligently working to resolve them in upcoming releases.

* When headphones without a microphone are connected, the internal microphone must be manually enabled.
* Bluetooth audio devices, e.g. headsets, speakers, are not yet fully supported.

## Test App
Additionally, there are known issues in the SyncStage Test App that are not related to the SDK itself.

* State of internal microphone and direct monitor will be not up to date after plugging in / out headphones
