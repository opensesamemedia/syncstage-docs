???+ warning

    SyncStage SDK for Android is currently available only in PREVIEW-ONLY mode, which means it is not yet recommended for production usage.

The current version of the SDK contains some known issues. However, we are diligently working to resolve them in upcoming releases.

* When headphones without a microphone are connected, the internal microphone must be manually enabled.
* Robotic sound - on some smartphones, audio quality drops occasionally.
* Bluetooth audio devices, e.g. headsets, speakers, are not yet fully supported.
