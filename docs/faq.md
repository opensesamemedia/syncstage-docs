__Q. SDK does not work as expected, but the application is building and running, what can I do about it?__

A. Some problems might occur if the app user did not grant all required permissions. Before using the SyncStage object, make sure that all of the required permissions are granted.

__Q. Can users connect their audio stream via SyncStage audio pipeline when not connected to the 5G network?__

A. Yes, 5G is not a must. Your users can connect using their WiFi network or LTE connection, however some ISPs can block traffic of our packets, so switching to the mobile network from WiFi will be needed.
