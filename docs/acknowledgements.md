We'd like to give a shout out to following open source projects that were used in the SDK development:

## [FFMPEG](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)

The SyncStage Android SDK is dynamically linked with unmodified libraries of FFmpeg licensed under the LGPLv2.1. The source code of these FFmpeg libraries, the compilation instructions, and the LGPL v2.1 license are provided in Github.

## [OPUS](https://opus-codec.org/license/)


## [Java/Android WebSocket Client](https://github.com/gusavila92/java-android-websocket-client)

A very lightweight WebSocket client library for JVM based clients or Android which aims to implement the WebSocket protocol as defined in RFC 6455. It has no dependencies and the jar file is only 22KB.
