## Connection over WiFi

Some ISP providers, and/or routers do not allow for NAT traversing. It may cause problems with UDP audio transmission that gets blocked by a firewall.

We are currently working on a fallback TCP mode that will cure that problem regardless of your application usersâ€™ network conditions.

## Internal microphone

Internal microphone feature might cause problems on some smartphones including app crash. We are currently working on resolving that issue.
