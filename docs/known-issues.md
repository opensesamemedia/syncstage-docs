## Connection over WiFi

Some ISP providers, and/or routers do not allow for NAT traversing. It may cause problems with UDP audio transmission that gets blocked by a firewall.

We are currently working on a fallback TCP mode that will cure that problem regardless of your application usersâ€™ network conditions.


## Android
* When headphones without a microphone are connected, the internal microphone must be manually enabled.
* Robotic sound - on some smartphones, audio quality drops occasionally.
* Switching between Wi-Fi and mobile networks, or vice versa, during a session causes the app to crash.
* Disabling the internet connection during a session leads to an app crash.
* Losing network coverage results in the app crashing.
* Users may be removed from a session when the app runs in the background and the screen is locked.
