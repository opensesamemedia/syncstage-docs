## Distance impact

Each session can be created in one of multiple zones around the world. Make sure that application users that are going to join the session are within geographical proximity to the zone location. Best experience is within 250 miles / 400 kilometers radius from the zone. You can freely choose the zone of the deployment during the ‘Create Session’ step.

Data transmission speed has its upper bounds. That’s physics, you cannot overtake photons that run at the speed of light. That speed is extremely high but not infinite, distance will add additional milliseconds to the latency.

If your users are connecting from distant places, they will not be probably able to sing or jam together, still they will have much more synchronous experience compared to any other communication tools available on the market.

## Jitter impact

Application users connected to low quality networks with high traffic, or with a bad range of a mobile or WiFi signal may have problems with bandwidth consistency, their latency will fluctuate. High jitter can badly impact the overall audio latency.

## Headphones

The most recommended way of communicating with the SyncStage audio pipeline is by using wired headphones. They provide the lowest latency and reduce the effort our SyncStage audio pipeline needs to do with removing noises, so we can save additional milliseconds for even better synchronization. Bluetooth technology is not well suited for real time communication. This wireless technology can introduce itself at least 100 ms of latency.

## Audio interfaces

Coming soon :)
