# Audio Interfaces

A good audio interface is key to achieving high sound quality. Fortunately, you can connect the audio interface of your choice to SyncStage.

As a general rule, if your smartphone or tablet is compatible with a particular audio interface, SyncStage should be as well.

The steps needed to connect the audio interfaces vary between different types of the devices. 
Here are two main ones:

## Audio Interfaces for Mobile Devices

SyncStage seamlessly integrates with audio interfaces designed for mobile devices, such as the iRig HD 2 with Lightning or USB-C connectors. These interfaces are user-friendly and have the advantage of drawing power directly from the smartphone or tablet, simplifying the setup process.

### Steps
1. Connect an audio interface designed for smartphones to your device using either a Lightning or USB-C connector.
2. Launch the SyncStage app.
3. If you want to hear your own audio in real-time, enable the "Direct Monitor" option.
   
## Audio Interfaces For Desktop
Audio interfaces in this category work well with SyncStage for desktop. Using them with a smartphone or tablet is possible but requires additional steps, as they often have high power requirements that cannot be met directly by a mobile device.

Here are a few popular examples:
