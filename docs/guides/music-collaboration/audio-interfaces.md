## Audio Interfaces For Mobile Devices

SyncStage seamlessly integrates with audio interfaces designed for mobile devices, such as the iRig HD 2 featuring Lightning or USB-C connectors. These interfaces are user-friendly and offer a distinct advantage: they can draw power directly from the smartphone itself. This simplifies the setup process and ensures convenient operation.
