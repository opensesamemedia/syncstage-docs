# Importance of Network Latency
A fast and stable network is critical for a real-time experience. The faster and more stable the connection, the better the experience.

Below is a mapping of network parameters to the expected experience for **music jamming**, the most demanding use case.

| Expected Experience | Latency | Jitter | Packet Loss |
| :-----------------: | :-----: | :----: | :---------: |
| <big>:partying_face:</big> | <= 15 ms | <= 2.0 ms | <= 0.010% |
| <big>:smiley:</big> | 16ms to 25ms | 2.1ms to 5.0ms | 0.011% to 0.02% |
| <big>:neutral_face:</big> |  25ms to 35ms | 5.1ms to 8.0ms | 0.021% to 0.03% |
| <big>:confused_face:</big> |  > 35ms | > 8.0ms | > 0.03% |

!!! note
    
    The final experience may vary for different use cases. Voice communication use cases are much less demanding.
