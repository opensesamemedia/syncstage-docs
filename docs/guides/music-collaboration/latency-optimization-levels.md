# Latency Optimization Levels
Each use case has its own latency and quality requirements. For voice communications, clarity is key, whereas sub-100ms latency isn't required. For real-time music collaboration, low and stable latency is paramount. To address the needs of various use cases, SyncStage offers a Latency Optimization Level parameter that allows for a trade-off between latency and network fluctuation resilience. The table below shows the available modes.


| Level Name                           | Description                                                                                                | Use Case |
| ------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------|
| Ultra Fast                           |  SyncStage focuses on delivering the lowest and most stable latency. Good network conditions required. | Jamming, Songwriting Sessions |
| Best Performance                     | SyncStage focuses on delivering low latency. In poor network conditions, audio cracks can occur. | Jamming, Songwriting Sessions |
| Optimized | Similar to High Quality but slightly more focused on reducing latency. | Recording Sessions, Voice Chat |
| High Quality | SyncStage tries to maintain the highest possible quality regardless of network fluctuations. | Recording Sessions, Voice Chat |

If your network is very stable, the mode choice doesn't matter much. Feel free to experiment to find what works best for you.
