## iOS

SyncStage SDK can be used in iOS OS Version 14.0.

## Android

The minimum recommended Android version is 12. We can operate on lower distributions starting from Android 10, but on some devices the full ultra low latency potential will not be reached. SyncStage is compatible with armeabi-v7a and arm64-v8a CPU architectures.
